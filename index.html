        <p>My name is Matthew McGee. I was born and raised in Cleveland Ohio. I enjoy playing basketball and riding motorcyles. I have a deep rooted passion for computers electronics and cell phones. I grew up in the 90s at the begining of the digital age.</p>
        
        <p>I attended business school at a local community college in my early 20s. For the next eight years I applied the skills and knowledge I gained running my families online retial business. I always enjoyed using computers from a user end but always had the desire to learn how the software and programming worked. After mastering the user of the computer I thought it was time to challange myself with a new and exciting adventure. So far coding has been and exciting journey. I look forward to whats lies ahead as I begin my journey into the world of programming.</p>
